I have written my simulation in Python. Python, because this is my favourite programming language that I am using 
daily.

To run the simulation use: 

	python main.py simpleInput.txt
	
- where the second term specifies input file that will be used for simulation.

This command will output all simulation to command line (together with statistics, optimised parameters,
warnings or errors)

I have written some test for my simulation.

To run these use:

	python unitTest.py
	
It contains all tests I have written. I have added all tests into one file just for simpler test process 
(running only one test file for testing all cases is easier than running separate tests)
